## Day 5: 5 Jan 2017

**Today’s progress:** Started the [FCC “Random Quote Machine” project](https://www.freecodecamp.com/challenges/build-a-random-quote-machine). It's been so long since I did the exercises in the “JSON APIs and Ajax” section of FCC, I had to go back and look at what I did. They show you just what you need for this project. Worked on this project for about an hour and a half.

**Thoughts:** I was feeling tired of Bootstrap, so for this project I went with vanilla HTML5 and CSS. I would like to create my own JSON file of selected quotes, but it seems like that might be a poor use of time, as it is not coding per se. Maybe later.

**Learned today:** Can use [Twitter code](https://publish.twitter.com/#) for the tweet button. Found an API for an existing quotations site and will use that when I get to the Ajax part (tomorrow, I hope). How to [use Google Fonts on Codepen](https://codepen.io/team/sparkbox/full/OMdwoJ).

**Links to work:** [Random Quote Generator](http://codepen.io/macloo/full/xgbyjB/), a Free Code Camp project.

## Day 4: 4 Jan 2017

**Today’s progress:** Finished the FCC “Build a Personal Portfolio Webpage” project! I decided to use Bootstrap's column styles to create a flexible grid for thumbnails that link to my work. I used [this file](https://github.com/macloo/learning-bootstrap/blob/master/grid_example_enhanced.html) that I made last year when learning Bootstrap for the first time and modified the grid code to work with 400-pixel-wide site thumbnails with captions.

**Thoughts:** The trick to this grid is putting all the images in one row, even though they take up more than 12 columns, and using the weird Bootstrap style `class="clearfix visible-xs-block"` to make it fully responsive. (This is likely to be different in Bootstrap 4.)

**Learned today:** I can store images free at [Postimage](https://postimg.org/). Put my thumbnails there.

## Day 3: 3 Jan 2017

**Today’s progress:** Finished the responsive large image code (both CSS and JavaScript) for the top section of the portfolio. I might tweak the text behavior a bit more later on, but for now it's working well.

**Thoughts:** It's so time-consuming to adjust a big background image to be responsive. There's probably a library or plugin for this that I don't know about.

**Learned today:** How to combine `background-size: cover;` and `background-position: center;` and write JavaScript to change the way the background behaves on a phone screen. `$(window).height()` is handy.

## Day 2: 2 Jan 2017

**Today’s progress:** Built and implemented a working PHP sendmail page for the contact form in my “Build a Personal Portfolio Webpage” project (see [Resources](resources.md) for link). Tested. Works. Note that my contact form is pretty much copied from [here](https://bootswatch.com/sandstone/#forms). Also added large responsive background image to About section. Added a panel to the footer.

**Thoughts:** Lots of time spent on getting that background image to behave nicely. Reworked some JavaScript I figured out previously for another project. Not done with the About section yet. Portfolio section still empty.

**Learned today:** `background-size: contain;` and `background-size: cover;` (CSS) for a responsive background image. I thought `contain` would work, but it turned out that `cover` was what I needed.

## Day 1: 1 Jan 2017

**Today’s progress:** Forked the [100 Days Of Code repo](https://github.com/Kallaway/100-days-of-code); updated [Log](log.md) and [Rules](rules.md). Also changed the README to link to the [original repo](https://github.com/Kallaway/100-days-of-code). Started the “Build a Personal Portfolio Webpage” project. Made/edited the navbar and DIVs for each section. Coded social icons, using Font Awesome. Added contact form.

**Thoughts:** Beginning “100 Days Of Code” would be quite a challenge if you'd never used GitHub before. (Of course, it's a great chance to learn to use GitHub!) At [Free Code Camp](https://www.freecodecamp.com/macloo), I’ve completed the Front End Development Certification lessons through “JSON APIs and Ajax” with one exception: “Build a Personal Portfolio Webpage.” Next up: “Intermediate Front End Development Projects."

**Learned today:** How to add jQuery and other files to a Codepen.io project. How to use alert colors as background colors in Bootstrap. How to install Font Awesome via CDN ([see how](http://fontawesome.io/get-started/)), and how to code the icons (yay!).

**Links to work:** “Build a Tribute Page”: [Georgia O’Keeffe, Artist](http://codepen.io/macloo/full/mORjyd/), in which I practiced using Bootstrap. This is a Free Code Camp project I finished earlier. Today I started “Build a Personal Portfolio Webpage”: [Another Free Code Camp project](http://codepen.io/macloo/full/rjBKLo/) with more Bootstrap. I exported today’s code [as a gist](https://gist.github.com/macloo/4448f77d928a7e3283910de0aab9f845).
